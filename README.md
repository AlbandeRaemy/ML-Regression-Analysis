# ML-Regression-Analysis

A set of Jupyter Notebooks solutions for the regression model in my class of Machine Learning - DAT-5303.

Each of the case studied had strict requirements based on high model performance, bias/ variance tradeoff, model run-time, and selected libraries.

I used multiple different models (Logistic, Full Tree, Pruned Tree, Tune LR, Tuned Tree, Random Forest, Tuned Random Forest, GBM, Tuned GBM) and compared their AUC scores

About the case
Apprentice Chef, Inc. is an innovative company with a unique spin on cooking at home. Developed for the busy professional that has little to no skills in the kitchen, they offer a wide selection of daily-prepared gourmet meals delivered directly to your door. Each meal set takes at most 30 minutes to finish cooking at home and also comes with Apprentice Chef's award-winning disposable cookware (i.e. pots, pans, baking trays, and utensils), allowing for fast and easy cleanup. Ordering meals is very easy given their user-friendly online platform and mobile app.

Regression Case:

After three years serving customers across the San Francisco Bay Area, the executives at Apprentice Chef have decided to take on an analytics project to better understand how much revenue to expect from each customer within their first year of using their services. Thus, they have hired you on a full-time contract to analyze their data, develop your top insights, and build a machine learning model to predict revenue over the first year of each customer’s life cycle. They have explained to you that for this project, they are not interested in a time series analysis and instead would like to “keep things simple” by providing you with a dataset of aggregated customer information.
